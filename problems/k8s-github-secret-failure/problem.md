# Kubernetes GitHub Secret Authentication Failure

## Context
You're a Senior DevOps Engineer at a mid-sized fintech company. It's Tuesday morning, 9:30 AM EST, and you've just received several Slack alerts from the #deployments channel. The automated deployment pipeline that handles customer-facing microservice updates has been failing for the past 2 hours.

**Team Structure**: 
- 3-person DevOps team managing 50+ microservices
- Development teams deploy 10-15 times per day
- On-call rotation with 4-hour response SLA

**Business Impact**:
- Critical customer feature rollouts are blocked
- 3 development teams are waiting for deployments
- Customer support is asking about delayed bug fixes

## Systems Involved
- **Kubernetes cluster** (EKS v1.28) running on AWS
- **GitHub Enterprise** for source code and package registry
- **ArgoCD** for GitOps deployments
- **Jenkins** for CI/CD pipelines
- **HashiCorp Vault** for secrets management

## Problem Statement

**What's Failing**: 
The `payment-processor` service deployment is stuck in a `Pending` state. ArgoCD shows the application as "Progressing" but pods are failing to start with authentication errors when trying to pull from the private GitHub Container Registry.

**When It Started**: 
First failure was at 7:45 AM EST, approximately 15 minutes after the daily 7:30 AM automated certificate rotation job ran.

**User Impact**:
- Payment processing service is still running (existing pods), but cannot deploy updates
- New payment features scheduled for today's release are blocked
- Unable to deploy critical security patches to payment service

**Recent Changes**:
- Yesterday: Sarah from the Security team mentioned they were "cleaning up old GitHub accounts"
- Last week: Migrated from DockerHub to GitHub Container Registry
- This morning: Automated certificate rotation completed successfully (all other services working)

## Available Information

**Your Access**:
- `kubectl` access to production EKS cluster
- ArgoCD web UI and CLI access
- Jenkins administrator access
- GitHub Enterprise admin access
- AWS Console access (limited to EKS, ECR, Secrets Manager)
- Vault UI access (read-only for troubleshooting)

**Monitoring Tools**:
- CloudWatch for AWS logs and metrics
- Prometheus + Grafana for application metrics
- ArgoCD UI for deployment status
- GitHub Action logs for CI pipeline status

**Time Pressure**:
- Development teams are blocked and asking for ETAs
- Release manager wants status update in 30 minutes
- Customer support ticket volume increasing due to delayed bug fixes

## Your Investigation

You need to:
1. **Identify the root cause** of the authentication failure
2. **Determine the scope** - is this affecting other services?
3. **Implement a fix** that restores deployment capabilities
4. **Verify the solution** works end-to-end
5. **Document lessons learned** to prevent recurrence

The team is counting on you to resolve this quickly while maintaining the security and reliability standards your company requires.

## Constraints
- **No direct pod access** - company policy requires all debugging through logs and metrics
- **Change management** - any GitHub organization changes require Security team approval
- **Compliance** - all changes must be logged for SOX audit requirements
- **Limited rollback options** - this is a deployment tool issue, not a service issue
